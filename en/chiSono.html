<p>Hi, I’m Silvano: automation engineer, hacker and PhD student.</p>

<p>From an early age I had an interest in the scientific world, to which was added a special interest concerning “how things work” and a nature of experimenter. To be honest, I still have the bad habit of tearing apart everything comes in my hands to study its inner workings. :)</p>

<p>After attending the scientific high school (in Italy called <em>liceo scientifico</em>), I landed to Politecnico di Milano: here, I got the Bachelor’s degree in Automation and Control Engineering in 2016 and in 2019 the Master’s degree (on the same topic) discussing a thesis entitled <em>“Periodic event-based control with past measurements transmission and multiple control computations: design, analysis and FPGA implementation”</em>.<br />
Now I’m still in Politecnico as a PhD student of Information Technology, area <em>Systems and Control</em>, under the supervision of Prof. Alberto Leva.</p>

<p>Currently my main interests - both personal and concerning my research activity - are in control theory, electronics and programming, especially with regards to the so-called * embedded systems *.</p>

<p>During my university life I was member of the association <a href="http://www.skywarder.eu">Skyward experimental Rocketry</a>, in the Electronics Department, where I took part in the development of the hardware and software of some of the on-board systems of R2α, the rocket currently being developed. However, I mainly worked on the design and implementation of a data acquisition and process control system to be used in a rocket engine test bench for the development of <a href="http://www.skywarder.eu/blog/hre100k/">HRE100K</a> project.</p>

<p>Since 2015, I contribute to the research activity of Prof. Alberto Leva. The main research topics are: control and control-based design of computing systems and networks, development of automatic tuning of industrial controls and event-based control systems.</p>

<p>In my free time, instead, I devote myself to reading, agricolture activities, railway modelling and to various other things, more or less technological. Sometimes I also do ham radio activity under the callsign IU2KWO.</p>

<p>To whom interested in contactin me, my e-mail address is: <strong>silseva{at}fastwebnet{dot}it</strong> (sorry, but it’s a way to avoid having my mailbox filled by spam).</p>
