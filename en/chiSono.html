<p>Hi, I’m Silvano: automation engineer, hacker and PhD student.</p>

<p>From an early age I had an interest in the scientific world, to which was added a special interest concerning “how things work” and a nature of experimenter: I always enjoyed disassembling any kind of thing to discover its inner workings.
To be honest, I still have this (bad?) habit: the only difference is that, over time, I have refined techniques and instruments! :)</p>

<p>Ar regards my school career, after attending the scientific high school (in Italy called <em>liceo scientifico</em>), I landed to Politecnico di Milano. Here I devoted myself to engineering courses: I got the Bachelor’s degree in Automation and Control Engineering in february 2017 and a couple of years later, in october 2019, the Master’s degree - on the same topic - discussing a thesis entitled: <em>“Periodic event-based control with past measurements transmission and multiple control computations: design, analysis and FPGA implementation”</em>.<br />
Now I’m still in Politecnico as a PhD student of Information Technology, area <em>Systems and Control</em>, under the supervision of Prof. Alberto Leva.</p>

<p>During my university life I was member of the association <a href="http://www.skywarder.eu">Skyward experimental Rocketry</a>, in the Electronics Department, where I took part in the development of the hardware and software of some of the on-board systems of R2α, the rocket currently being developed. However, I mainly worked on the design and implementation of a data acquisition and process control system to be used in a rocket engine test bench for the development of <a href="http://www.skywarder.eu/blog/hre100k/">HRE100K</a> project.</p>

<p>Since 2015, I contribute to the research activity of Prof. Alberto Leva. The main research topics are: control and control-based design of computing systems and networks (i.e. clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks or control of the processor’s temperature in computer), development of automatic tuning of industrial controls and event-based control systems.</p>

<p>Currently my main interests - both personal and concerning my research activity - are in control theory, electronics and programming, especially with regards to the so-called <em>embedded systems</em>.</p>

<p>In my free time, instead, I devote myself to reading, agricolture activities, railway modelling and to various other things, more or less technological. Sometimes I also do ham radio activity under the callsign IU2KWO.</p>

<p>To whom interested in contactin me, my e-mail address is: <strong>silseva{at}fastwebnet{dot}it</strong> (sorry, but it’s a way to avoid having my mailbox filled by spam).</p>
